# My Portfolio Website
This is just a simple website created using Bulma. It also uses GitHubs API to fetch my Public Repositories and display them in a list. 

# TODO:
- Sort Repos by last updated.
- Add About Me & Experience section.
- Complete all links.
- Hide forks
- Slow more data about each repo maybe? Or if not make them smaller.
